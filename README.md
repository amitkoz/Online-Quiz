# Online Quiz Game


The quiz loads questions ,from the Open Trivia Database, and presents them to the user.
Each question is limited in time.
If the user answers incorrectly - the answer is marked in red, and the game continues to the next question.
If the user answers correctly - the answer is marked in green, the score increases, and the game continues to the next question.
Each correct answer earns 20 points ('CORRECT_BONUS').
In addition, the remaining time (to answer the question) is also added to the score.
This way, the faster you answer -> the longer time left -> the higher bonus will be added (and vice versa).
At the end of the game, the score is displayed to the user with a proper celebration,
and he is given the option to save it under his name.
Only the 5 high-scores are displayed.
